# Fader Models

This is the folder containing the 3D printable models for the boards.

In the Schematics folder there was also a 16 fader variant, this has currently not been modelled, because I don't have/know anyone with a 3D printer large enough for it, the 8 fader will barely fit on an Ender 3 (Normal, Pro, V2).
