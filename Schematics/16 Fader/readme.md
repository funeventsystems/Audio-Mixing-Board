# 16 Fader Schematic
You can find the PDF schematic, and the fritzing schematic. 

Substitute the rotating potentiometer with a sliding potentiometer. Like this one, https://www.amazon.ca/DAOKI-Logarithmic-Potentiometer-Arduino-Electronic/dp/B08SLPV4VD.

There is currently no design for the 16 fader model, just theoretically should work.
